The input is handled by the code editor. To print in C, you can use the printf(), function which is declared in the stdio.h library. The syntax of the printf statement is printf("format string",argument_list); To print a string, , the statement would look like this: printf("%s", s);. Here %s is the format specifier for a null-terminated array of characters. Look at the code given below, to see how to print in C.

Problem Setter's code:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() 
{
   
    char s[100];
    scanf("%[^\n]%*c", s);
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    printf("%s", s);

    return 0;
}
